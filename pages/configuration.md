### Configuration->Options' Stock Manager 

Once you've installed _POSM_, you can customize the options' stock manager using these settings available in _Configuration->Options' Stock Manager_:

| Field Name | Field Description | Added |
| ---- | ---- |
| Products' Options' Stock Manager: Version | Displays the plugin's version number. | &nbsp; |
| Products' Options' Stock Manager: Release Date | Displays the plugin's release date. | &nbsp; |
| General: Enable Products' Options' Stock Manager? | Allows you to easily enable or disable the overall _POSM_ functionality in your store. This allows you to install the plugin and create your managed options before the store-side processing begins. (Default: **true**) | v1.5.7 |
| General: Duplicate Model Numbers | Specify how the _POSM_ admin-level tools (_Catalog->Manage Options' Stock_ and _Catalog->Options Stock — View All_) should handle duplicate model numbers. Choose from 1\. **Allow** <span class="smaller">(default)</span>. No special handling is provided. Duplicate model numbers are allowed. 2\. **Disallow**. Duplicate model numbers are highlighted in the tools' display; you cannot save changes for an option-combination that includes a duplicate model number. 3\. **Message-Only**. Duplicate model numbers are highlighted, but duplicate values **can** be saved. | v2.1.0) |
| General: Options' Stock Re-order Level | Specify the stock-level at which a low-stock email should be sent, if configured, for any products managed by the _Options' Stock Manager_. (Default: 5) | &nbsp; |
| General: Back-in-Stock Date Reminder | If your store is using POSM's back-in-stock labels with availability dates, you might want a reminder when a date is imminent. Identify the number of days prior to any expiration that the notification should be issed; set the value to 0 (the default) if you do not want a reminder. | v2.3.0 |
| General: Divider Color | Allows you to customize the divider color used in the [Catalog->Manage Options' Stock](#mos) tool, specified as a CSS color. | &nbsp; |
| General: Option Types to Manage? | Identify the option types to manage. The current version of the plugin supports dropdown (0) and radio-button (2) options only. (Default: **0,2**) | &nbsp; |
| General: Optional _Option Types_ List | Enter types of options to be ignored when determining if a product's option-combination is managed, using a packed, comma-separated list. The built-in Zen Cart option types are Dropdown/Select (0), Text (1), Radio (2), Checkbox (3) and File (4) — Read-Only (5) options are automatically ignored. | v1.5.2 |
| General: Optional _Option Names_ List | Enter the list of optional product options for your store, using a packed, comma-separated list of their option_id values. All option values associated with the options that you identify here are ignored when determining if a product's option-combination is managed. Use this value in conjunction with the "Optional _Option Types_ List" to further refine your store's option-combination configurations. For example, if the "Dropdown" option type is in your _Option Types to Manage_ list, but you have one dropdown-type attribute that defines a "Gift Wrapping" choice, that choice doesn't affect whether or not the selected option-combination is in- or out-of-stock. You'd list that option's `option_id` value here to have it excluded from the _POSM_ option-combinations. | v1.5.2 |
| Stock Status Display: Show Messages? | Choose where (Store Only, Admin Only, Both or Neither) the _POSM_ in-/out-of-stock messages will be displayed. (Default: Both). If you choose **Store Only** or **Both**, this status will be displayed to your customers on the shopping_cart, checkout_confirmation and account_history_info pages. See also the _Dependent Attributes: Stock Status Display_ setting, below, which operates independently of this setting. If you choose **Admin Only** or **Both**, the in-/out-of-stock messages will be displayed within your Customers->Orders details display, invoices and packing slips. | v1.6.1 |
| Stock Status Display: Messages for Unmanaged Options? | Should the store-side processing include in-/out-of-stock messages for non-POSM-managed products? If set to **true**, the messages will be displayed depending on the unmanaged product's stock quantity — In Stock if > 0; the default out-of-stock message (PRODUCTS_OPTIONS_STOCK_NOT_IN_STOCK), otherwise. | v1.6.1 |
| Stock Status Display: Include In-Stock Status? | Identifies whether (true) or not (false) an "In Stock" status should be included with the store-side products' display — the status _always_ displays if an option-combination is out-of-stock. (Default: true). | &nbsp; |
| Admin: Model Number Field Width | If the Model/SKU numbers used by your store need more space to display, update this setting to contain a valid CSS `width` value to increase those inputs' width. The setting is used in both _Catalog->Manage Options' Stock_ and _Catalog->Options' Stock — View All_. (Default: 9em) | v2.1.8 |
| Dependent Attributes: Enable | Identifies whether (true) or not (false) your store-side processing should include the dependent-attributes' javascript. (Default: true) | &nbsp; |
| Dependent Attributes: Insert "Please Choose"? | Identifies whether or not the plugin's dependent-attributes processing should insert a "Please Choose" selection into a product's drop-down options. If _false_, the first option value for each attribute is _assumed_ to be a "Please choose …" type value. **Note:** This setting **_does not_** apply when a product has a single drop-down option. The language-file constants associated with this setting are present within `/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/products_options_stock_extra_definitions.php`. | &nbsp; |
| Dependent Attributes: Stock Status Display | Identify whether or not the plugin's dependent-attributes processing should include the in- or out-of-stock status for each attribute value on the final (or only), selectable attributes option. Note that this setting works in conjunction with the value you set for **Show In-Stock Status?**; if that value is _false_ and this setting is _true_, then only out-of-stock status will be displayed on the final, selectable attributes option. (Default: true) | &nbsp; |
| Dependent Attributes: Show In-Stock Quantity in Status? | If the _Dependent Attributes: Show Stock Status?_ setting (see above) is **true**, should the option-combinations' in-stock quantities be displayed as part of the status? (Default: true) | v1.5.6 |
| Dependent Attributes: CSS Selector | Identify the CSS selector (default: _.wrapperAttribsOptions_) that contains each attribute group. **Note:** This value should be changed _only_ if your custom template has modified the attributes' display formatting. In all cases, all the attributes must reside in an HTML container with the id of **productAttributes**. | v1.4.0 |
| Dependent Attributes: Use Minified Script File? | Identify whether or not the plugin's dependent-attributes processing should load the minified version of the jQuery script (default: _true_), reducing the page-load time for a product's page. | v1.5.5 |
| View All: Allow Model Number Updates? | Should the "View All" processing for _Catalog->Manage Options' Stock_ enable the managed variants' model numbers to be updated? If set to **false**, the model numbers are displayed but cannot be updated; you'll need to update the model numbers on a product-by-product basis. | v1.6.1 |
| View All: Maximum Products/Page | Identify the maximum number of products to view per page in the "View All" processing (default: 20). If your store includes a "large" number of products and/or variants that are _POSM_-managed, setting this value to a large number could result in the message `You don't have permission to access /YOUR_ADMIN/products_options_stock_view_all.php on this server.`. | v2.0.1 |
| Shopping Cart: Display Model Numbers? | Should the shopping_cart page display a product's model-number? If you choose `true`, a product's model number is appended to its name for the display, e.g. "Product Name [model]", if the model-number is not empty. | v4.0.0 |
| Enable debug? | Controls whether (true) or not (false) the store-side processing should create debug-log files for problem-determination. If enabled, the processing will write records to a myDEBUG-POSM-*.log file, present in your store's /logs directory. (Default: false) | &nbsp; |
