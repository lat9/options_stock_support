# Storefront Interface Changes

Once you've configured _POSM_ and identified which products' options are to be stock-managed, there are some interface changes on your store's customer-facing view.

## Using Dependent Attributes

If you configure your products to use [_dependent attributes_](./configuration.md), then the attribute selections are enabled (in ascending sort-order) once their predecessor value(s) have been chosen. The example below shows the display once the _Color_ attribute was chosen â€” the _Memory_ attribute dropdown was disabled until the _Color_ was selected.

The final attribute for the product (the _Memory_ for this example) shows the options' stock status for each selection. The example shows both in- and out-of-stock messages for the various option combinations. If you've set **Dependent Attributes: Show In-Stock Quantity in Status?** to _true_, then each option-combination's in-stock quantity displays as part of the "In Stock" status.

**Note:** Starting with _POSM_ v1.5.5, if an option-combination is not configured, those choices will not be displayed to the customer. In the example shown, if there was no option-combination for _Color: Blue_ and _Memory: 4mb_, the _Memory: 4mb_ selection is not displayed if the customer chooses _Color: Blue_.

### Identifying CSS Selectors

Starting with *POSM* v4.2.0, there are additional CSS selectors that you configure to identify significant elements within your template's rendering of a product's attributes-block, each within the ***Options' Stock Manager***'s admin [configuration](./configuration.md):

1. ***Dependent Attributes: Outer Selector***.  This selector identifies an outer, wrapping element that encompasses ***all*** elements of an individual option.  For `zc156` (and previous)-era templates, this is normally set to an empty string; for the `zc157` built-in templates, this should be set to `.attribBlock`.
2. ***Dependent Attributes: Inner Selector***.  This selector identifies an inner element that contains, at a minimum, an option's name element.  Its value defaults to `.wrapperAttribsOptions`.
   1. All `select` (drop-down) type inputs must reside in this block.
   2. Radio-button inputs must reside either in this block or, if an attribute includes associated images, in the block identified by the ***Attributes' Images' Selector***.
3. ***Dependent Attributes: Option Name Selector***.  This selector identifies the `in-line` element that contains an option's name, defaulting to `.optionName`.  POSM's dependent-attributes' jQuery handling uses this selector to locate the option's name to let the customer know if they've not made a selection.
4. ***Dependent Attributes: Attributes' Images' Selector***.  This selector identifies the wrapping element that encompasses each option-specific attribute image block, which might also contain option-specific radio-button inputs.

*POSM*'s dependent-attributes' jQuery handling makes use of the configured selectors to locate various option-specific elements in the HTML generated by your template.  If you've configured the ***Outer Selector*** as either an empty string or as a value equal to the ***Inner Selector***, the jQuery script adds a `.posm-wrapper` class around each ***Inner Selector*** and any subsequent ***Attributes' Images' Selector*** blocks.

## Displaying Out-of-Stock Messages

When a customer adds an options-stock-managed product to their cart, the option-combination's in-stock (if _Show In-Stock Status_ is set to true) or out-of-stock status message accompanies the product's display on the shopping-cart, checkout-confirmation and account-history-info pages. The stock-related message also accompanies each product's line item within the order's confirmation email.

**Notes:**

1.  The _In Stock_ label is included only if you've set the [Stock Status Display: Include In-Stock Status?](./configuration.md) value to **true**.
2.  Starting with _POSM_ v1.6.1, the labels (either in-stock or out-of-stock) are included _only if_ you've set [Stock Status Display: Show Messages?](./configuration.md) to either **Store Only** or **Both**.
