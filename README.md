## Current Version: v4.2.2, released 2020-11-17.

Welcome to the support area for the _Products' Options' Stock Manager_ plugin from Vinos de Frutas Tropicales, available [here](https://vinosdefrutastropicales.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2_7&products_id=46).

If you are upgrading a _POSM_ installation from a version _prior to_ v4.0.0, click [here](./pages/upgrading_to_posm_400.md) for additional instructions.

I've started to migrate the majority of the plugin's documentation here from the distributed readme to reduce the overall size of that distribution.  Choose from one of the following links:
